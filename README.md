<!--intro-start-->

Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.

`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.


What does it do?
----------------

While cibuildwheel itself requires a recent Python version to run (we support the last three releases), it can target the following versions to build wheels:

|                | macOS Intel | macOS Apple Silicon | Windows 64bit | Windows 32bit | Windows Arm64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux x86_64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux i686 | manylinux<br/>musllinux aarch64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux ppc64le | manylinux<br/>musllinux s390x | manylinux<br/>musllinux armv7l | iOS | Pyodide |
|----------------|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|----|-----|-----|---|-----|-----|
| CPython 3.8    | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | N/A | ✅ | ✅  | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  | ✅⁵ | N/A | N/A |
| CPython 3.9    | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | ✅² | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  | ✅⁵ | N/A | N/A |

| PyPy 3.8 v7.3  | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  | N/A | N/A | ✅¹ | ✅¹  | ✅¹ | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| PyPy 3.9 v7.3  | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  | N/A | N/A | ✅¹ | ✅¹  | ✅¹ | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

| GraalPy 24.2   | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  | N/A | N/A | ✅¹ | N/A  | ✅¹ | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

<sup>¹ PyPy & GraalPy are only supported for manylinux wheels.</sup><br>
<sup>² Windows arm64 support is experimental.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Free-threaded mode requires opt-in using [`CIBW_ENABLE`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable).</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Experimental, not yet supported on PyPI, but can be used directly in web deployment. Use `--platform pyodide` to build.</sup><br>
<sup>⁵ manylinux armv7l support is experimental. As there are no RHEL based image for this architecture, it's using an Ubuntu based image instead.</sup><br>

- Builds manylinux, musllinux, macOS 10.9+ (10.13+ for Python 3.12+), and Windows wheels for CPython, PyPy, and GraalPy
- Works on GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI, and Cirrus CI
- Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
- Runs your library's tests against the wheel-installed version of your library

See the [cibuildwheel 1 documentation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/1.x/) if you need to build unsupported versions of Python, such as Python 2.

Usage
-----

`cibuildwheel` runs inside a CI service. Supported platforms depend on which service you're using:

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows | Linux ARM | macOS ARM | Windows ARM | iOS |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| GitHub Actions  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       | ✅        | ✅        | ✅          | ✅³  |
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       |           | ✅        | ✅²         | ✅³  |
| Travis CI       | ✅    |       | ✅      | ✅        |           |             |     |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         | ✅        | ✅        |             | ✅³  |
| Gitlab CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅¹       | ✅        |             | ✅³  |
| Cirrus CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅        | ✅        |             | ✅³  |

<sup>¹ [Requires emulation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#emulation), distributed separately. Other services may also support Linux ARM through emulation or third-party build hosts, but these are not tested in our CI.</sup><br>
<sup>² [Uses cross-compilation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#windows-arm64). It is not possible to test `arm64` on this CI platform.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Requires a macOS runner; runs tests on the simulator for the runner's architecture.</sup>

<!--intro-end-->

Example setup
-------------

To build manylinux, musllinux, macOS, and Windows wheels on GitHub Actions, you could use this `.github/workflows/wheels.yml`:

<!--generic-github-start-->
```yaml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build_wheels:
    name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-24.04-arm, windows-latest, macos-13, macos-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Used to host cibuildwheel
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5

      - name: Install cibuildwheel
        run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==3.0.0b1

      - name: Build wheels
        run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
        # to supply options, put them in 'env', like:
        # env:
        #   CIBW_SOME_OPTION: value
        #   ...

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: cibw-wheels-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ strategy.job-index }}
          path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
```
<!--generic-github-end-->

Legal note
----------

Since `cibuildwheel` repairs the wheel with `delocate` or `auditwheel`, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.

It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.

This is similar to static linking, so it might have some license implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

Changelog
=========

<!-- START bin/update_readme_changelog.py -->

<!-- this section was generated by bin/update_readme_changelog.py -- do not edit manually -->

### v3.0.0

Not yet released, but available for testing.

Note - when using a beta version, be sure to check the [latest docs](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/latest/), rather than the stable version, which is still on v2.X.

#### v3.0.0b1

_19 May 2025_

- 🌟 Adds the ability to [build wheels for iOS](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/latest/platforms/#ios)! Set the [`platform` option](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/latest/options/#platform) to `ios` on a Mac with the iOS toolchain to try it out!
- 🌟 Adds support for the GraalPy interpreter! Enable for your project using the [`enable` option](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/latest/options/#enable). (#1538)
- ✨ Adds CPython 3.14 support, under the [`enable` option](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/latest/options/#enable) `cpython-prerelease`. This version of cibuildwheel uses 3.14.0b1.

    _While CPython is in beta, the ABI can change, so your wheels might not be compatible with the final release. For this reason, we don't recommend distributing wheels until RC1, at which point 3.14 will be available in cibuildwheel without the flag._ (#2390)
- ✨ Adds the [test-sources option](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/latest/options/#test-sources). \[discussion about the test cwd change and how to use to come!\]
- ✨ Added `dependency-versions` inline syntax (#2123)
- 🛠 EOL manylinux options can no longer be specified by their shortname. Full OCI URL can still be used for these images, if you wish (#2316)
- 🛠 Build environments no longer have setuptools and wheel preinstalled. (#2329)
- ⚠️ PyPy wheels no longer built by default, due to a change to our options system. To continue building PyPy wheels, you'll now need to set the [`enable` option](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/latest/options/#enable) to `pypy` or `pypy-eol`.
- ⚠️ Dropped official support for Appveyor. If it was working for you before, it will probably continue to do so, but we can't be sure, because our CI doesn't run there anymore. (#2386)
- 📚 A reorganisation of the docs, and numerous updates (#2280)

### v2.23.3

_26 April 2025_

- 🛠 Dependency updates, including Python 3.13.3 (#2371)

### v2.23.2

_24 March 2025_

- 🐛 Workaround an issue with pyodide builds when running cibuildwheel with a Python that was installed via UV (#2328 via #2331)
- 🛠 Dependency updates, including a manylinux update that fixes an ['undefined symbol' error](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/1760) in gcc-toolset (#2334)
-

### v2.23.1

_15 March 2025_

- ⚠️ Added warnings when the shorthand values `manylinux1`, `manylinux2010`, `manylinux_2_24`, and `musllinux_1_1` are used to specify the images in linux builds. The shorthand to these (unmaintainted) images will be removed in v3.0. If you want to keep using these images, explicitly opt-in using the full image URL, which can be found in [this file](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/blob/v2.23.1/cibuildwheel/resources/pinned_docker_images.cfg). (#2312)
- 🛠 Dependency updates, including a manylinux update which fixes an [issue with rustup](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/issues/2303). (#2315)

========

Another very similar tool to consider is [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a shell script toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It is used as a basis to build some of the big data science tools, like SciPy.

If you are building Rust wheels, you can get by without some of the tricks required to make GLIBC work via manylinux; this is especially relevant for cross-compiling, which is easy with Rust. See [maturin-action](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin-action) for a tool that is optimized for building Rust wheels and cross-compiling.
